# Voice-Controlled-Wikipedia-Searcher
A python project that allows you to search Wikipedia using your voice.
The libraries nessecary for this script to work are: requests(https://pypi.org/project/requests/), PYTTSX3 (https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/), SpeechRecognition (https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) and Wikipedia (https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/).

You will need an active internet connection in order to use this as, without it the Wikipedia library and the SpeechRecognition library won't work.
